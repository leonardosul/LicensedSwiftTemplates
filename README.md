Licensed Swift Templates
------------------------

This is a collection of templates for creating Swift files that have an open source license included in the header. This means that if you are working on an open source project you can use these templates without having to copy and paste the license in to every new file you create.

This was inspired by a similar template collection that exists for creating objective-C classes, [Xcode-licensed-templates](https://github.com/mattt/Xcode-Licensed-Templates) by [mattt](https://github.com/mattt).

You can select from your favorite open source licenses to be embedded in the header:

- [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license)
- [Apache 2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
- [BSD 3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)
- [GPL v3](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)
- [Zlib](http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib)
- [The Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/)
